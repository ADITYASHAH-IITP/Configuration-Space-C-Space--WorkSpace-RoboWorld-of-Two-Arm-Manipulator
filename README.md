For a two-arm manipulator with two revolute joints I have wrote a code in Matlab to do the following. 
1.Draw the robot world to display the robot and some polygonal obstacles
2.To generate the robot end-effector workspace. 
3.To generate the configuration space and display the configuration space obstacles.
